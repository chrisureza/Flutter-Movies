# Flutter Movies

This is an App to see information about latest movies and search for older movies info too. This App uses Flutter and API calls.

## Code Info

This Project is based on an example made by Fernando Herrera in this course (https://fernando-herrera.com/#/curso/flutter), however the version in this repo is different from the one it is based, the code is structured differently and have some new improvements made by myself.

For help getting started with Flutter, view the [online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
